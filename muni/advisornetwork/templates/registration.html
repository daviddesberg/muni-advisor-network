                        (Our conference is held on campus at the University of Illinois. However, the conference hotel, the Wyndham Garden, is is located off campus. Conference transportation comes in the form of coach busses taking you and your delegation to and from the conference location and hotel throughout the weekend. There is a $50 Transportation Fee that covers you and your entire delegation throughout the conference should you sign up for transportation.)
